        <p class="long-copy">
            Succulents are plants that have telltale fleshy leaves containing sap. The reason that they have those leaves is so they hold as much moisture as possible. Where they are found in desert areas, but can be found in multiple places around the globe.
            Succulents cover a wide variety of types of plants. Aloe plants, cacti and even orchids can be considered succulents. ZZ plants and other common indoor plants are usually in the succulent family. They are popular because they are relatively low maintenance, require little watering or pruning and some species need very little light to thrive.
            Succulents get their name because of the thick, fleshy, sap-filled leaves that are their trademark. These leaves allow them to hold and retain water more effectively than plants with thinner leaves.

            <p class="long-copy1">
                You can grow Succulents from either seeds or cuttings.  To begin with cuttings, carefully remove any leaves on the stem below the rosette-- wiggle them gently from side to side and make sure to keep the base of the leaf intact. Once all the leaves have been removed, use shears to snip the rosette, leaving a short stem attached. Allow the cuttings to dry for a few days in an empty tray until the raw ends have calloused. Next, the cuttings can be rooted in soil or water.

            <h3>Very little water</h3>
            <p class="long-copy1">
                Over millions of years the planet's land and climate have altered, so too have the plants. Continents drift and mountain ranges slowly rise out of vast prehistoric jungles, blocking air currents and altering the climate. Seasons develop, so do climatic belts. In many parts of the world, water has gradually become a scarce commodity.
                Succulents eventually rose to take over the wastelands where little else could live. They're champs at quickly gathering any water that comes their way, storing it for future use and protecting it from thirsty visitors.
